Forest Fire Simulation with Advanced Features
This Python script simulates wildfires spreading in a forest with advanced features. The simulation includes the following components:

Lakes and Rivers: Act as fire breaks that flames cannot cross, providing realistic barriers to fire propagation.
Tree Catch Fire Probability: Introduces a percentage chance that a tree will catch fire from its neighbor, making the simulation more dynamic and unpredictable.
Different Types of Trees: Various types of trees are included, each with different chances of catching fire, allowing for more nuanced fire spread dynamics.
Multiple States of Burning Trees: Trees have different states of burning, requiring multiple simulation steps for a tree to burn down completely, enhancing realism and complexity.
Usage
To run the simulation, simply execute the Python script forest_fire_simulation.py. Press Ctrl-C to stop the simulation.

Requirements
Python 3.11
bext module (Install using pip install Bext)
